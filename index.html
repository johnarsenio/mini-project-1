        in the seat of scoffers! <span class="bold-num">2</span> But his delight
        is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night.
        <span class="bold-num">3</span> He will be like a tree firmly planted by
        streams of water, Which yields its fruit in its season And its leaf does
        not wither; And in whatever he does, he prospers.
        <span class="bold-num">4</span> The wicked are not so, But they are like
        chaff which the wind drives away.
        <span class="bold-num">5</span> Therefore * the wicked will not stand in
        the judgment, Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.

        earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against
        his anointed, saying, <span class="bold-num">2</span> “Let us break
        their chains and throw off their shackles.”
        <span class="bold-num">4</span> The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the

        in his wrath, saying, <span class="bold-num">6</span> “I have installed
        my king on Zion, my holy mountain.” <span class="bold-num">7</span> I
        will proclaim the Lord's decree: He said to me, “You are my son; today I
        have become your father. <span class="bold-num">8</span> Ask me, and I
        will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your
        possession. <span class="bold-num">9</span> You will break them with a
        rod of iron[b]; you will dash them to pieces like pottery.”
        <span class="bold-num">10</span> Therefore, you kings, be wise; be
        warned, you rulers of the earth. <span class="bold-num">11</span> Serve
        the Lord with fear and celebrate his rule with trembling.
        <span class="bold-num">12</span> Kiss his son, or he will be angry and
        your way will lead to your destruction, for his wrath can flare up in a
        moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

      <h5>The LORD Praised for Giving Deliverance.</h5>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-num">1</span> "I love You, O LORD, my strength."
        <span class="bold-num">2</span> The LORD is my rock and my fortress and
        my deliverer, My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; My shield and the
        horn of my salvation, my stronghold. <span class="bold-num">3</span> I
        call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, And I am saved from my
        enemies. <span class="bold-num">4</span> The cords of death encompassed
        me, And the torrents of ungodliness terrified me.
        <span class="bold-num">5</span> The cords of Sheol surrounded me; The
        snares of death confronted me. <span class="bold-num">6</span> In my
        distress I called upon the LORD, And cried to my God for help; He heard
        my voice out of His temple, And my cry for help before Him came into His
        ears. <span class="bold-num">7</span> Then the earth shook and quaked;
        And the foundations of the mountains were trembling And were shaken,
        because He was angry. <span class="bold-num">8</span> Smoke went up out
        of His nostrils, And fire from His mouth devoured; Coals were kindled by
        it. <span class="bold-num">9</span> He bowed the heavens also, and came
        down With thick darkness under His feet.
        <span class="bold-num">10</span> He rode upon a cherub and flew; And He
        sped upon the wings of the wind. <span class="bold-num">11</span> He
        made darkness His hiding place, His canopy around Him, Darkness of
        waters, thick clouds of the skies. <span class="bold-num">12</span> From
        the brightness before Him passed His thick clouds, Hailstones and coals
        of fire. <span class="bold-num">13</span> The LORD also thundered in the
        heavens, And the Most High uttered His voice, Hailstones and coals of
        fire. <span class="bold-num">14</span> He sent out His arrows, and
        scattered them, And lightning flashes in abundance, and routed them.
        <span class="bold-num">15</span> Then the channels of water appeared,
        And the foundations of the world were laid bare At Your rebuke, O LORD,
        At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.
        <span class="bold-num">16</span> He sent from on high, He took me; He
        drew me out of many waters. <span class="bold-num">17</span> He
        delivered me from my strong enemy, And from those who hated me, for they
        were too mighty for me. <span class="bold-num">18</span> They confronted
        me in the day of my calamity, But the LORD was my stay.
        <span class="bold-num">19</span> He brought me forth also into a broad
        place; He rescued me, because He delighted in me.
        <span class="bold-num">20</span> The LORD has rewarded me according to
        my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands He has
        recompensed me. <span class="bold-num">21</span> For I have kept the
        ways of the LORD, And have not wickedly departed from my God.
        <span class="bold-num">22</span> For all His ordinances were before me,
        And I did not put away His statutes from me.
        <span class="bold-num">23</span> I was also blameless with Him, And I
        kept myself from my iniquity. <span class="bold-num">24</span> Therefore
        the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to
        the cleanness of my hands in His eyes.
        <span class="bold-num">25</span> With the kind You show Yourself kind;
        With the blameless You show Yourself blameless;
        <span class="bold-num">26</span> With the pure You show Yourself pure,
        And with the crooked You show Yourself astute.
        <span class="bold-num">27</span> For You save an afflicted people, But
        haughty eyes You abase. <span class="bold-num">28</span> For You light
        my lamp; The LORD my God illumines my darkness.
        <span class="bold-num">29</span> For by You I can run upon a troop; And
        by my God I can leap over a wall. <span class="bold-num">30</span> As
        for God, His way is blameless; The word of the LORD is tried; He is a
        shield to all who take refuge in Him.
        <span class="bold-num">31</span> For who is God, but the LORD? And who
        is a rock, except our God, <span class="bold-num">32</span> The God who
        girds me with strength And makes my way blameless?
        <span class="bold-num">33</span> He makes my feet like hinds' feet, And
        sets me upon my high places. <span class="bold-num">34</span> He trains
        my hands for battle, So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
        <span class="bold-num">35</span> You have also given me the shield of
        Your salvation, And Your right hand upholds me; And Your gentleness
        makes me great. <span class="bold-num">36</span> You enlarge my steps
        under me, And my feet have not slipped.
        <span class="bold-num">37</span> I pursued my enemies and overtook them,
        And I did not turn back until they were consumed.
        <span class="bold-num">38</span> I shattered them, so that they were not
        able to rise; They fell under my feet.
        <span class="bold-num">39</span> For You have girded me with strength
        for battle; You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
        <span class="bold-num">40</span> You have also made my enemies turn
        their backs to me, And I destroyed those who hated me.
        <span class="bold-num">41</span> They cried for help, but there was none
        to save, Even to the LORD, but He did not answer them.
        <span class="bold-num">42</span> Then I beat them fine as the dust
        before * the wind; I emptied them out as the mire of the streets.
        <span class="bold-num">43</span> You have delivered me from the
        contentions of the people; You have placed me as head of the nations; A
        people whom I have not known serve me.
        <span class="bold-num">44</span> As soon as they hear *, they obey me;
        Foreigners * submit to me. <span class="bold-num">45</span> Foreigners *
        fade away, And come trembling out of their fortresses.
        <span class="bold-num">46</span> The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock;
        And exalted be the God of my salvation,
        <span class="bold-num">47</span> The God who executes vengeance for me,
        And subdues peoples under me. <span class="bold-num">48</span> He
        delivers me from my enemies; Surely You lift me above those who rise up
        against me; You rescue me from the violent man.
        <span class="bold-num">49</span> Therefore * I will give thanks to You
        among the nations, O LORD, And I will sing praises to Your name.
        <span class="bold-num">50</span> He gives great deliverance to His king,
        And shows lovingkindness to His anointed, To David and his descendants
        forever *.
